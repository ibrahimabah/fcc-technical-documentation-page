# Technical Documentation Page

Building a Technical Documentation Page that will serve as instruction or reference for a topic.

## Objective:
Build an app that is functionally similar to [Technical Documentation Page](https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks)

## User Stories:
1. You can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
2. Within the #main-doc element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of five
3. The first element within each .main-section should be a header element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
