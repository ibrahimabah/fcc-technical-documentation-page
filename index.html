            <p class="headings">Beyond the Basics</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">If you have a bit of knowledge already, the next step is to learn HTML and CSS in detail: start with our Introduction to HTML module and move on to our CSS first steps module.</p>
            <p class="headings">Moving onto scripting</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS already, or you are mainly interested in coding, you'll want to move on to JavaScript or server-side development. Begin with our JavaScript first steps and Server-side first steps modules.</p>
            <p class="headings">Frameworks and tooling</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">After mastering the essentials of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you should learn about client-side web development tools, and then consider digging into client-side JavaScript frameworks, and server-side website programming.</p>

            <p class="paragraphs">The code examples you'll encounter in the Learning Area are all available on GitHub. If you want to copy them all to your computer, the easiest way is to download a ZIP of the latest master code branch.</p>
            <p class="paragraphs">If you prefer to copy the repo in a more flexible way that allows for automatic updates, you can follow the more complex instructions:</p>
            <ol class="ol_list">
                <li class="ol_data">Install Git on your machine. This is the underlying version control system software that GitHub works on top of.</li>
                <li class="ol_data">Open your computer's command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux, macOS).</li>
                <li class="ol_data">To copy the learning area repo to a folder called learning-area in the current location your command prompt/terminal is pointing to, use the following command: <em class="code_snip">git clone https://github.com/mdn/learning-area</em> </li>
                <li class="ol_data">You can now enter the directory and find the files you are after (either using your Finder/File Explorer or the cd command).</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="paragraphs">You can update the learning-area repository with any changes made to the master version on GitHub with the following steps:</p>
            <ol class="ol_list">
                <li class="ol_data">In your command prompt/terminal, go inside the learning-area directory using cd. For example, if you were in the parent directory: <em class="code_snip">cd learning-area</em> </li>
                <li class="ol_data">Update the repository using the following command: <em class="code_snip">git pull</em> </li>
